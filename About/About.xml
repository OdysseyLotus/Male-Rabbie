	<description>Adds male Rabbie.
	
Haha, bet you didn't think I'd get two mods done in one day, but here you go, the second of the two most requested mod addons to be made (the other one is Male Kurin if you want to check that out). I have added male bodies, faces, hair (from Gloomy Hair mk2 and Roppoi Hair), and apparel. Now you got your boy rabbits to match with your girl rabbits.

If there are any other alien races you want me to add males to, let me know and I might devote some time to creating those assets and patches as well.

Additionally, to the original mod authors, if you have any issues or comments, please let me know. I have the utmost respect for you and your efforts and I don't want to offend.</description>
